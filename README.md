## H7B3 Base ##
Designed to be a simple starting point for a STM32H7B3 project without the weight of the HAL and with a cleaner directory structure.

TODO: 

* [ ] UART Peripheral Support for simple printf debug
* [ ] CMake build system generation
* [ ] Application test suite integration
* [ ] CI/CD support (In-the-loop hardware?)
